# Cereal Rating Analysis | Project 3

**Exploratory Data Analysis & Interactive Power BI Dashboard**

![Dashboard Preview](Screenshots/dashboard_full.png)

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of **77 breakfast cereals** to uncover the key nutritional factors that influence their health ratings. The analysis combines rigorous data cleaning, statistical testing, visualization, and predictive modeling, complemented by an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

**Objective**: Identify what makes a cereal "healthy" according to its rating and provide actionable insights for product development and manufacturers.

## 🔍 Key Insights (Final Report Summary)

### 1. Data Quality & Preprocessing
- Missing values (`-1`) were replaced with column means.
- Outliers were treated using the IQR method and replaced with medians.
- Data is now realistic and ready for analysis.

### 2. Nutritional Drivers of Cereal Rating
| Nutrient     | Correlation with Rating | Impact          |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Sugars       | **-0.77**               | Very Strong Negative |
| Protein      | **+0.47**               | Moderate Positive |
| Fat          | **-0.42**               | Moderate Negative |
| Fiber        | **+0.34**               | Positive        |

### 3. Other Important Findings
- **Calories** show a clear negative relationship with rating.
- Significant differences exist between **manufacturers** (ANOVA F-statistic = 5.89).
- Shelf position has a weak association with calorie content.

### 4. Predictive Model
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Features**: `protein`, `fat`, `sugars`
- **Performance**: **R² = 0.789** (78.9% of variance explained)
- Conclusion: These three nutrients alone are strong predictors of cereal health rating.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built to make insights accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

**Dashboard Highlights**:
- KPI summary cards
- Interactive scatter plots (Sugars, Protein, Calories vs Rating)
- Manufacturer performance comparison
- Nutrient correlation heatmap
- Shelf position analysis

→ See full dashboard in the [`Dashboard/`](Dashboard/) folder.

## 💡 Final Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Sugar Reduction** — The most effective way to boost cereal ratings.
2. **Increase Protein Content** — Strong positive driver of higher ratings.
3. **Balance Calories and Fiber** — Lower calorie + higher fiber cereals perform better.
4. **Manufacturer Strategy** — Brands with lower average ratings should reformulate high-sugar products.
5. **Use the Model** — Predict potential ratings for new cereal formulations before launch.
